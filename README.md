# DenoiseDeepPPG

DenoiseDeepPPG is one of the result in the project of Center of Advance Wearable technologies (CWAT). This especified part is foccuses on removing the noise artifact generated during the measurement of a photoplethysmography (PPG) signal. The signal used was sintetically generate using the alogorithm propouse by (). For the denoiser we used the Convolutional Neural Network propoused in the work (), that combines 3 convolutional leyers. For DenoiseDeepPPG, the code from Matlab has been adapted to work with PPG signal generated, the code has been adapted from https://github.com/zzh8829/yolov3-tf2.

This project is capable to remove high level of noise from a PPG signal used in biomedical aplications.

Matlab 2021 have been used in this project.
