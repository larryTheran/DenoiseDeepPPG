# DenoiseDeepPPG

DenoiseDeepPPG is one of the result in the project of Center of Advance Wearable technologies (CWAT). This especified part is foccuses on remouve the noise artifact generate in a photoplethysmography signal. The signal used was sintetically generate using the alogorithm propouse by ().   that combines Pix2Pix and YOLO arhitectures in order to remove people or other objects from photos.For Pix2Pix, the code from Tensorflow has been adapted, whereas for YOLO, the code has been adapted from https://github.com/zzh8829/yolov3-tf2.

This project is capable to remove high level of noise from a PPG signal used in biomedical aplications.

Matlab 2021 have been used in this project.

How does it work?
